# Explore-US-bike-share-data

Data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington are explored by using Python.
I have written  code to import the data and had answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
